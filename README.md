# Geometry / physics simulations
https://kij-exe.github.io/physics-engine/

Developed for my own educational purposes. I have implemented various concepts of computational geometry and put them into simulations with a trivial user interface.
These include:
- Raycasting
- Vector projection
- Three body simulation
- "Counting PI" simulation of colliding blocks

The website presents four setups to play around with. Explanations are given below the canvas.
