```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters.

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
